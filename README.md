# Open-Source-Electronic-Load

Welcome to the **Open-Source Electronic Load** project!

This repository provides the design, source code, and documentation for a customizable, open-source electronic load. The project is developed in C and aims to offer a platform for electronics enthusiasts, students, and engineers who need a programmable load for testing power supplies, batteries, or other electronic circuits.

## Features

- Fully open-source hardware and firmware
- Designed for flexibility and expandability
- Suitable for testing DC power supplies and batteries
- Customizable load profiles (constant current, constant power, etc.)

## Repository Structure

- **Firmware**: Source code for the microcontroller that controls the electronic load
- **Hardware**: Schematics, PCB layouts, and hardware documentation
- **Documentation**: User guides and developer notes

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   `git clone https://github.com/BurakOnemli/Open-Source-Electronic-Load.git`
2. **Review the hardware documents** to understand the design and required components.
3. **Build the hardware** according to the provided schematics and BOM.
4. **Flash the firmware** onto the chosen microcontroller.

## Dependencies

- A C toolchain for the supported microcontroller
- PCB design software (e.g., KiCad or Eagle)
- Standard electronics lab tools for assembly
